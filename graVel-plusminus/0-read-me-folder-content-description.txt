1.      Software 'graVel±'

        The program gravel± was used for the analyses in Klösch et al.
        (2024a). 
1.1     "1-1-graVel-plusminus.exe": The executable of graVel±. You may have 
        to start it from the Windows command prompt.
1.2     "1-2-graVel-plusminus.for": This is the code of graVel±, written in
        FORTRAN language. 
1.3     "1-3-used-gfortran-compiling-commandline.txt": The command line 
        used to compile graVel± with the GNU Compiler Collection 
        (GCC).

2.      Example data from the Drava River

        The data were taken from Kloesch et al. (2024b) and prepared
        here in the format required for use with graVel±. See Klösch
        et al. (2024a) and Klösch et al. (2024b) on how the data were 
        derived. These files can be used to reconstruct the results of 
        Klösch et al. (2024a) and serve as test and example files for 
        the application of graVel±.
2.1     "2-1-shear-stress-CEST.txt": Shear stress time series at the 
        seeding location of the bedload tracers. 
        1st column: Time, where 1 day corresponds to one unit.
        In this file, the time is given in Excel number format 
        (starting on 1/1/1900). Please note that the shear stress time
        series must start at least one time step before the time of 
        seeding. For the Drava, the 15-min intervals of the recordings 
        of the gauge provided a sufficient resolution of the time 
        series. In smaller catchments with more flashy events, the 
        resolution of the time series may need to be increased (e.g.,
        by linear interpolation).
        2nd column: Bed shear stress in N m-2.
2.2     "2-2-32p1mm.txt", "2-2-45p6mm.txt", "2-2-63p4mm.txt", 
        "2-2-93p2mm.txt", "2-2-140p4mm.txt": 
        These files are input files created for each of the five 
        tracer size classes. The files contain four columns: The date
        of the earlier tracer survey, the date of the later tracer
        survey, the date of the seeding of the respective tracer (in 
        the study of Klösch et al. (2024a) it was the same time for all 
        tracers) and the intermediate travel distances between the two 
        surveys. The time is given in Excel numbers format. 
        The files are named after the tracer size, which is 
        represented by the length of the b-axis. In the file names 
        used here, the "p" stands for the decimal point.
        Here, the grain sizes of the tracers are represented by the 
        length of the b-axis used in the analyses (see right column of
        Table 2 in Klösch et al. (2024a)).
2.3     "2-3-readme-used-settings-in-regression-runs.txt": This file 
        shows the settings used when applying graVel± to obtain 
        the results reported in Klösch et al. (2024a).
